# Lightbulb Simulation
**A lightbulb simulation built with Processing and Sound API provided by The Processing Foundation. [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pSJU89lt8c7MC4VSGPu1VsPwVTacmU8z/view?usp=sharing)  executables for windows.**

## How To Run?

 1. [Download](https://processing.org/download/) Processing.  Processing is available for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Select your choice to download the IDE.
 2. Download  the [sound library](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/sound/index.html) provided by The Processing Foundation which provides a simple way to work with audio. Open Processing, goto *Tools* ‚Üí *Add Tool...* ‚Üí *Libraries* ‚Üí search for *"Sound"* ‚Üí select *"Sound"* ‚Üí click *"Install"* placed at the bottom right corner. You can also download the [source code](https://github.com/processing/processing-sound) for this library from GitHub and configure it manually.
 3. [Download](https://github.com/theanasuddin/Programming-In-Processing/archive/main.zip) the source code (zipped) for Lightbulb Simulation and unzip it.
 4. Goto the project folder üìÅ and rename the *"Lightbulb Simulation"* folder to *"lightbulb_simulation"* found inside the project folder.
 5. Move the *"lightbulb_simulation"* folder to sketchbook location. Default sketchbook location is `C:\Users\<name>\Documents\Processing` , here `<name>` is the name of your user account.
 6. Go inside the *"lightbulb_simulation"* folder and open the *"lightbulb_simulation.pde"* source file with Processing.
 7. Click on Run ‚ñ∂ button inside Processing.
